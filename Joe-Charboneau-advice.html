                <h4>Google is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When in doubt or lost between steps. A quick Google search can make all the difference in the world.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Comment your code!</h4>
                <p>A quick message or a long message describing the steps helps you in the long run. You never know if 
                    you will reuse a certain function or line of code.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
